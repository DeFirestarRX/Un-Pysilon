# Un-Pysilon
Discord resets every token thats found on github. This repo is used to reset PySilon bot tokens. Please also note that none of these bot tokens work anymore and that this repo is **automated**. If you got notified, leave a message!

# This is how the message they get looks like
Hey {User},

Safety Jim here! It appears that the token for your bot, {Bot Name} has been posted to the internet. Luckily, our token-scanning gremlins noticed, and have reset your bot's token - hopefully before anyone could have maliciously used it!

Your token was found here: https://github.com/DeFirestarRX/Un-Pysilon/blob/main/tokens

Be more careful in the future, and make sure to not accidentally upload your token publicly!
